# comparison operators are binary operators that need two
# operands to do the operation and give back the result a Boolean.

# greaterThan -
y > x       # (3 is greaterThan 2)
# => true

# greaterThan-equalTo -
y >= x       # (3 is greater than equal to 2)
# => true

# lessThan -
y < x       # (3 is lessThan 2)
# => False

# lessThan-equalTo -
y <= x       # (3 is less than equal to 2)
# => False

# equalTo -
y == z      # (3 is equal to 3)
# => True

# not(!)
y != z      # (3 is not equal to 3)
# => False
